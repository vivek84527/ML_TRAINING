# precision(= exactness / quality)
#           = how useful the search results are
#           = measure of exactness or quality


# recall ( = completeness / quantity / sensitivity)
#          = how complete the results are
#          = measure of completeness or quantity.



#F1 score = is the harmonic mean of precision and sensitivity(=recall)

# F1 = 2 x ( (precission x recall) / (precission + recall) )


#Question-1:

# precission=.77
# recall = .87
# F1 = ? 0.7894


#Question-2:

# precission=.71
# recall = .55
# F1 = ?
